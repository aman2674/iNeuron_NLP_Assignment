There are several ways of calculating this frequency, with the simplest being a raw count of instances a word appears in a document. Then, there are ways to adjust the frequency, by length of a document, or by the raw frequency of the most frequent word in a document.\n","- The inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents. This means, how common or rare a word is in the entire document set. The closer it is to 0, the more common a word is. This metric can be calculated by taking the total number of documents, dividing it by the number of documents that contain a word, and calculating the logarithm.\n","- So, if the word is very common and appears in many documents, this number will approach 0. Otherwise, it will approach 1.\n","Multiplying these two numbers results in the TF-IDF score of a word in a document. The higher the score, the more relevant that word is in that particular document."],"metadata":{"id":"GoF-9SkIHrFW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---"],"metadata":{"id":"JLGFAUYdIjl6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Which factors influence Natural Language Processing interpretation?**"],"metadata":{"id":"VNfr8qzgI45F"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Natural Language Processing or NLP works on the unstructured form of data, and it depends upon several factors such as regional languages, accent, grammar, tone, and sentiments."],"metadata":{"id":"pABhF2JoI33q"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---"],"metadata":{"id":"93aRaZjpI-Oi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **What are the different types of conversational interfaces?**"],"metadata":{"id":"oCfxlU_NJwDd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Types of Conversational User Interfaces**\n","\n","We can distinguish two distinct types of Conversational UI designs.
